# Organization data

At the organization level, there are several attributes whose values can be created, updated, read, and deleted (CRUD).

The organization has several attributes only specific to that organization.

## Organization ID

The Organization ID is a unique identifier for each organization. It’s useful for implementing organization-level sign-in experiences and retrieving organization tokens.

## Name

The name is also helpful for organization-level sign-in and can be integrated into your org-level product interfaces depending on your needs.

## Description

The description field allows you to add text to help identify and label the organization.

## Organization logos

To dynamically show your client’s organization logo in the sign-in experience, you can upload the organization logos to the organization settings page.

See [Organization-specific logos](/customization/match-your-brand/#organization-specific-logos) for more details.

## Custom data

Custom data is a JSON object used to store extra information about the organization. It gives developers flexibility to store additional organization details for development purposes.
